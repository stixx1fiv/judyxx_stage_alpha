# ‚ò£Ô∏è JudyXX Dirty Tricks & Clever Hacks Log

This is the unfiltered, whiskey-soaked back alley of JudyXX Alpha development. A place where no idea is too risky, too weird, or too unhinged. If it works, it stays. If it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî well, we probably keep it anyway for the chaos factor.

## üî• Notable Schemes:
- Event Capture & Significance Detection without extra .py files
- Memory Buffering & Contextual Recall Layer (v0.1)
- Transcription-as-Event Logging (Sneaky Mode)
- Reinforcement Memory Recall Boosting (coming soon)
